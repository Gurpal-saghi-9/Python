    "\n",
    "This project automates the process of interacting with a chat application, specifically designed to analyze chat history and generate humorous responses using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The virtual assistant, named Naruto, is a character that roasts people in a funny way, based on the chat history.\n",
